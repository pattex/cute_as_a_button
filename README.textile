h1. Cute As A Button

_Cute As A Button_ is a super simple one-button-app which helps me to focus my work time. The lag of features is compensated by simplicity.
It is based on the great "Shoes":http://shoes.heroku.com/  toolkit. Take a look at the Shoes documentation to figure out how to use it on your platform.

* because my repository list looks a littel less empty now
* i like the name
* and i was asked for it - hello Anna! :-)

Alikeness of parts of this text with some kind of an apology is not intended and might only happen accidentally.
